Some notes:

```
Threading and mutex are concepts used in programming to manage multiple threads of execution accessing shared resources.

Threading allows a program to have multiple threads executing concurrently, where each thread represents a separate of execution within the program. This enables tasks to be performed simultaneously, improving performance and responsiveness.

On the other hand, a mutex, short for mutual exclusion, is a synchronization primitive used to control access to shared resources. It ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time, preventing data corruption or conflicting accesses.
